* Build and install from source: Run `sh build.sh -i` in folder of build.sh file

### Charset conversion

Radio station streams may include tags - track artist and title.

If tags are not served in `UTF-8` encoding, non-latin characters may be printed as garbage characters and must be converted to `UTF-8` to make sense.

A specific source charset can optionally be set upon adding or editing each channel.

Unfortunately, charsets cannot be reliably determined automatically. Finding the right source charset for a channel's tags are therefore a matter of guessing - or guessing again. A tool like [2cyr/decode] may come useful.

Currently, this extension supports conversion of the following charsets:

* **windows-1251** - Russian, Bulgarian, Serbian Cyrillic and Macedonian
* **windows-1252** - Western European / Latin 1
* **windows-1253** - Greek
* **windows-1257** - Baltic
* **koi8-r** - Russian
* **koi8-u** - Ukrainian
